          Weâ€™ve developed a model called EduAssist, designed specifically to
          support educators and learners in an interactive, dynamic environment.
          The model processes educational content namely text content and audio
          files adapting to various subjects and teaching styles to offer
          tailored assistance. EduAssist can summarize key concepts, clarify
          complex ideas, and provide interactive explanations to ensure deeper
          understanding.

          It can engage in dialogue with users, adjusting its explanations based
          on feedback, and offer a variety of study aids .EduAssist is built to
          enhance both teaching and learning experiences by making educational
          content more accessible, engaging, and effective for a wide range of
          learners.
